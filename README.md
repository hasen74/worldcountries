# Kotlin101

You will find here our awesome project and some instructions to launch it.

This project is an app that you can use to get information on countries from all around the world.
You can go through a list and select a country. Then you will be able to know 
its capital city, its timezones, its currencies. A map generated thanks to the Google Maps API is also displayed.
A search bar is also available to restrict the results by name, continent, currency, language and timezone.

## Launch

- Go to Android studio
- Create a virtual device under android 9.0 and with Pie
- sync gradle dependencies by clicking the little elephant on the top right of your window
- Launch the app by clicking the green triangle
- if not already displaying on the device, go to the device's apps and look for an app named Kotlin101
- Now you should be able to see and use the app :)
